## 2026-10-11 - React Rendering Optimization
**Learning:** Found a component (`UnifiedInbox`) that performed multiple `Array.prototype.filter` operations on the same array during render, creating an O(5N) operation with intermediate array allocations.
**Action:** Replaced multiple filters with a single `Array.prototype.reduce` pass to compute all counts simultaneously and wrapped it in `useMemo` to prevent recalculation on every render.
